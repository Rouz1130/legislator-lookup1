EMBER EXTEND JSON WEB API'S
-Ember CLI is backend agnostic meaning it doesn't know or care where data comes
 from or is stored
-API is short application programming interface.

ANATOMY OF AN API GET request
-When a web API GET request is made, most of the necessary
 information is included in the URL
 -The ? in the URL is called a query string. Information following the ? is not part of the URL path but instead represent
  the query parameters being sent with the request.
-Parameters in the query string are separated by the & symbol.
-JSON-formatted APIs to gather data for our Ember models in our applications.
